					<h4>Improving climate modelling</h4>
					<p> One of the largest ways that Computer scientist can help climate change is through modelling
						with data that has been collected. Climate
						modelling has enabled us to get a better idea of the impact of climate change on the planet. It
						gives us a more acuate view of:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Where?</b> Some places are much more severe affected. It makes it easier to predict where
							is likely to be next hit by extreme weather
							such as floods.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>How?</b> Additional modelling also allows us to predict the greater impact of these
							changes. We can model the impact on animals and
							the biodiversity of the planet.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>When?</b> We are also able to better predict when these things are going to happen
							enabling us to better prepare for the future.

					<h4>Connecting people together</h4>
					<p>
						As we have learned through the Coronavirus pandemic, with the ability to connect to others more
						easily the need to travel is less necessary
						than ever. It makes it very easy to imagine a world where there is no need to fly across the
						world for business meetings.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A survey from

								The Department for Transport

							said <b>65%</b> of those traveling for business were attending a meeting.
