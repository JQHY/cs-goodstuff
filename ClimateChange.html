		<h4>Improving climate modelling</h4>
		<p>One of the largest ways that Computer scientist can help climate change is through modelling with data that
			has been
			collected. Climate modelling has enabled us to get a better idea of the impact of climate change on the
			planet. It
			gives us a more acuate view of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Where?</b> Some places are much more severe affected. It makes it easier to predict where is likely
				to be next hit by extreme weather such as floods.</li>
			<li><b>How?</b> Additional modelling also allows us to predict the greater impact of these changes. We can
				model the impact on animals and the biodiversity of the planet.</li>
			<li><b>When?</b> We are also able to better predict when these things are going to happen enabling us to
				better prepare for the future.</li>

		<h4>Connecting people together</h4>
		<p>As we have learned through the Coronavirus pandemic, with the ability to connect to others more easily the
			need to travel
			is less necessary than ever. It makes it very easy to imagine a world where there is no need to fly across
			the world
			for business meetings.

					The Department for Transport</a>
				said <b>65%</b> of those traveling for business were attending a meeting.</li>
