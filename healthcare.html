				<h1>Computing in Healthcare</h1>
				<div>
					<p>Computing has helped to allow us to develop significant advantages in the healthcare industry.
					</p>
					<p>One of the things computing has helped in is the development of 3D printing and consequently the
						ability
						to 3D print a wide variety of things, ranging from <a

						which have
						already helped lots of
						people, to internal organs, like <a
							href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/on-the-road-to-3-d-printed-organs-67187">hearts</a>
						, which are still in the development
						stage.</p>
					<p>Another thing that technology has improved in the healthcare industry is the storage of data.
						Being able
						to easily store, access and analyse data. This has ensured patients have a better experience
						when being
						treated as doctors can find their previous medical history much more easily than before.
						Additionally,
						holding data online allows for easy <a

							collaboration</a> with patientsâ€™
						data on both an individual and wider scale.</p>
