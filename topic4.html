				<h1>Everyday applications of Computing</h1>
				<p> Computing has been leveraged by Computer Scientists as a tool used to tackle problems that we face every day.
					 <br> From buying a coffee using contactless to using Google Maps to find the fastest route to work; we have become dependent on the application of computing in our daily routines whether we know it or not, arguably for the better. </p>
					 
				<p2> More recently we have seen supermarkets take a computational approach to keep track of how many customers are in the store in real-time, so they can make more accurate decisions on how many more customers they can let into the store at that given-time in line with the government guidelines on Covid-19. This is just one of the many applications of computing for good.
